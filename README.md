# Library API

This is a specification for the [Library API](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library) that was originally implemented
by Sylabs in the [singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) project,
and now is present in the following container registry implementations:

 - [Singularity Registry Server](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry)
 - [Hinkskalle Registry](https://github.com/csf-ngs/hinkskalle)
 
The specification here is a community effort to document and maintain this application
programming interface.
