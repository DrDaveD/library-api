# Library API

This is a specification for the Library API that was originally implemented
by Sylabs in the [singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) project,
and now is present in the following container registry implementations:

 - [Singularity Registry Server](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry)
 - [Hinkskalle Registry](https://github.com/csf-ngs/hinkskalle)
 - [Sylabs Cloud Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library)
 - [Singularity Enterprise](https://sylabs.io/singularity-enterprise/)
 
The specification here is a community effort to document and maintain this application
programming interface. To support this effort, Sylabs has contributed the
[OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client/blob/master/api/server/openapi.yml)
on which their services are based.
